# Stamp-It!

Stamp-It is an app that will let you make your own stamps using Ember to connect to a Ruby on Rails API.  I started this project setting up the API and rushed through it to get started tackling the challenge of Ember.

Unfortuantely, Ember was too much for me given the time frame of the project.  At every moment I felt like I was about to make a breakthrough and I would understand it better and things would speed up.  While sometimes this was true, frequently things just keep taking me too long to accomplish within the timeframe of this project.

The biggest individual hurdle I face continues to be datatypes.  While I've figured out how to console log data types in Javascript, Ember proved to be elusive to me.  There's a bit of code that I think should work to set the current order equal to the oldest order that is left open, but it's not functioning the way I want and I honestly don't know why.
